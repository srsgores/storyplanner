## Ember Data
Always aim to use native ember data when possible.

1. If we have access to an ember data model, we don't ever use `set`; we set the value directly.  If we previously used `set` within a component, and the ember data record is an argument (`this.args`), then we should consider moving the logic to an `action` that delegates to a service instead that mutates the record(s)
2. We should always use `async` functions when dealing with retrieving or saving records

## Ember
1. Put decorators on the same line as `function` names like `@action` and `@attr`
2. Use Ember Octane format, refactoring legacy code as necessary
3. Refactor `classNameBindings` to the corresponding template file
