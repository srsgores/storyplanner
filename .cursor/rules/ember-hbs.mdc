Follow these rules:

1. Do **not** include spaces before `/>` self-closing tags
2. Do **not** create new line `\n` characters to break up long lines of HTML
3. Always use double quotes `"`
4. Do not inline any logic and favour putting logic in controllers or components instead of templates
5. Use tabs for indentation

## Ember Handlebars
Remember: in Ember, we do "data up, actions down", meaning templates should have minimal logic and focus on content rather than on logic.

1. Place `/>` closing tags on the same line
2. Keep **ALL** attributes and arg assignments for components on the same line as the component itself
