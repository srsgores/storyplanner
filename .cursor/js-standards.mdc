Follow these standards:

1. Always use clear, unabbreviated variable names (`URL` and domain-specific names OK).  Avoid variable names like `i`, `j`, or `int`; instead, prefer `index`, `integer`, or whatever the variables represent
2. Use double quotes at all times or else template strings
3. Use tabs, not spaces
4. Do not put spaces in between curly or square brackets
5. Do not use dangling commas
6. Do not insert linebreaks, even for long lines; I have word-wrap enabled
7. Always prefer `async` to using `Promise`s
8. Never `return` early; instead wrap the function body in an `if` (one `return` per function, pure functions)
9. You don't have to keep function names super short, as long as they clearly describe what they do; longer can be better than shorter
10. Always aim for O of N rather than chaining method calls like `forEach`, `map`, and `reduce`; instead, prefer one `reduce`
11. Only use `=>` arrow functions when strictly necessary (`this` is used); otherwise, just use normal `function`s
12. Avoid, at all costs, vague variable names like `result` or `item`, and create variable names that describe their function
